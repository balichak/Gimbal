# Face Tracking Gimbal

This project uses an Arduino Uno, MG996R servo motors, and OpenCV to create a face-tracking gimbal. It can detect faces and adjust the camera position dynamically.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Smooth servo movements
- Customizable with different cameras and platforms

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- MG996R Servo Motors
- ESP32-CAM or USB Camera
- External Power Supply

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your Uno.
3. Install Python and dependencies (`pip install opencv-python`).
4. Run the Python script.
5. Assemble the hardware and connect it.
