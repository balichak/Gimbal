1. Arduino to MG996R Servo Motors

Pan Servo:
Signal (Orange): Connect to Digital Pin 9 on the Arduino.
Power (Red): Connect to +V of an external power supply (e.g., 5V-6V battery or adapter).
Ground (Brown): Connect to GND of the Arduino and the external power supply.
Tilt Servo:
Signal (Orange): Connect to Digital Pin 10 on the Arduino.
Power (Red): Connect to +V of the external power supply (same source as the pan servo).
Ground (Brown): Connect to GND of the Arduino and the external power supply.
2. Camera Module

ESP32-CAM or USB Camera:
If using an ESP32-CAM:
Follow its specific power and data requirements.
Connect to a host device for OpenCV processing over WiFi or USB.
If using a USB Camera:
Connect it to your PC/laptop directly via USB for image processing.
3. Power Supply

Ensure that the external power supply provides sufficient current for both servos (at least 2A, preferably 5-6V).
Common ground between the Arduino and the external power supply is essential for proper operation.
4. Additional Notes

GND Connection: All ground connections (Arduino, servos, power supply) must be tied together.
Decoupling Capacitors: Add a 470ÂµF capacitor across the servo power supply to smooth out voltage fluctuations caused by servo movements.
USB Power: Power the Arduino Uno via its USB port (connected to the PC/laptop running the Python code).
